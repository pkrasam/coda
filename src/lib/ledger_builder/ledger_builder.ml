  (*A Coinbase is a single transaction that accommodates the coinbase amount
  and a fee transfer for the work required to add the coinbase. Unlike a
  transaction, a coinbase (including the fee transfer) just requires one slot
  in the jobs queue.

  The minimum number of slots required to add a single transaction is three (at
  worst case number of provers: when each pair of proofs is from a different
  prover). One slot for the transaction and two slots for fee transfers.

  When the diff is split into two prediffs (why? refer to #687) and if after
  adding transactions, the first prediff has two slots remaining which cannot
  not accommodate transactions, then those slots are filled by splitting the
  coinbase into two parts.
  If it has one slot, then we simply add one coinbase. It is also possible that
  the first prediff may have no slots left after adding transactions (For
  example, when there are three slots and
  maximum number of provers), in which case, we simply add one coinbase as part
  of the second prediff.
